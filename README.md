## Introduction
The **QR Tag Project** is an interactive gaming experience combining mobile QR code scanning, location tracking, and real-time game mechanics. Players engage in a competitive game where they tag each other by scanning QR codes. The project consists of multiple modules, including location tracking with ESP32 devices, a mobile application for interaction, a game server for real-time updates, and a 3D game area modeled in Unreal Engine 5.

## Installation Guide
Follow the instructions below to install and run the components of the QR Tag Project:

### Server and Desktop App (Qt)
1. Install Qt and required tools:\
sudo apt update sudo apt install qt5-default qtcreator build-essential

2. Generate the Makefile:\
qmake server_desktop_app.pro make

3. Run the server application:\
./server_desktop_app


### Mobile Application (Android)
1. Install Android Studio and open the project:
- Go to `AndroidApp/` directory.
- Select "Open Existing Android Project" in Android Studio.
2. Sync Gradle:
- Click "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button.
3. Build the APK:

## Module Descriptions

### Location Tracking Module
**Purpose**: Track player positions using ESP32 devices in the game area.  
**Technologies**: ESP32, C/C++.  
**Development Environment**: Arduino IDE.  
**Challenges**: Signal strength issues and frequent disconnections due to large game area.  

### Game Server and 3D Modelling Module
**Purpose**: Manage game settings, track player positions, and visualize the game area.  
**Technologies**: Unreal Engine 5, C++, TCP/UDP Protocols.  
**Development Environment**: Visual Studio, Unreal Engine 5.  
**Challenges**: Issues with real-time data integration and 3D model collisions.

### Game Logic Module
**Purpose**: Implement game rules and mechanics (health points, tagging, score management).  
**Technologies**: C/C++, Arduino.  
**Challenges**: Delays in physical indicators (LEDs), ensuring accurate game rule enforcement.

### Mobile Application Module
**Purpose**: Provide an interface for players to interact with the game, display real-time stats, and scan QR codes.  
**Technologies**: Android NDK, ZXing Library.  
**Development Environment**: Android Studio.  
**Challenges**: QR scanning issues with certain devices and preventing exploitative gameplay mechanics.

### Desktop Application
**Purpose**: Manage the server-side logic, display 3D visualization of the game area, and handle game-related events.  
**Technologies**: Qt, C++.  
**Challenges**: Configuring the 3D model and managing server IP configurations.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Location Tracking**: Difficulty in obtaining real-time location updates due to ESP32 signal limitations.
2. **Game Server**: Problems with player movement and real-time data synchronization in the 3D model.
3. **Mobile App**: Camera issues with QR scanning and preventing misuse of game mechanics (e.g., self-kill).
4. **Game Logic**: Managing game rules with physical indicators like LEDs using multi-threading.
